By defining a conversion goal, such as a form submission, the module can track the conversion rate of different pages and identify high-performing content. This data, combined with insights from 'Advanced SEO Analytics', provides a complete understanding of user behavior and helps content creators optimize their content for maximum engagement and conversions.  For example, if users are consistently bouncing from a particular page, the module might suggest improving the page's readability, adding clearer calls to action, or redesigning the layout."
