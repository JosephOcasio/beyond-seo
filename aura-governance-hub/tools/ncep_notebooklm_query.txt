Extract only falsifiable conditional statements and explicit mathematical or physical constraints from the corpus.
Remove all interpretive, theological, financial, compliance, or narrative framing.
Present output only in this form:
CP_i: condition -> consequence

Rules:
- Keep only statements that can fail.
- Include explicit thresholds, inequalities, gate requirements, and function mappings.
- For each CP_i, include at least one failure mode in plain text.
- Do not summarize; enumerate.
